# Landing Page Project
A multi-Section landing Page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content added to the page.

# Features
   - Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list
   - Styling has been added for active states 
   (It is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page)
   - When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link smoothly scrolls to the appropriate section.
